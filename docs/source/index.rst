Welcome to STAM's documentation!
================================

**Stellar-Track-based Assignment of Mass (STAM)** is a `python` package that assigns mass, metallicity, or age, to stars based on their location on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (color-magnitude diagram), using stellar evolutionary tracks (not provided by this package).

The package has been tested for *Gaia* DR2 sub-solar main-sequence stars, using `PARSEC evolutionary tracks <http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd>`_.
See `Hallakoun & Maoz 2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..398H/abstract>`_ for details (please cite this paper if you use ``STAM`` in your publication; see :ref:`citing-and-attributing`).

For a quick start, see the :doc:`README <readme>`.
